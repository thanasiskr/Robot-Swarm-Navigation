# Robot-Swarm-Navigation
My diploma thesis on Robot Swarm Navigation. The result of the thesis is the implementation of an algorithm that allows a swarm of wheeled robots to navigate a dynamic environment, while maintaining a stable formation and avoiding possible obstacles. 
The implemented algorithm is a result of combining the traditional methods of Potential Field navigation and the Leader-Follower approach. Each robot navigates autonomously using the readings from the Sonar sensors and its Odometry.
